# Finishing Projects Plugin

## Current Status

We are working on completing the Projects plugin with full task and subtask management functionality. The core features are in place, but we've encountered and fixed several issues along the way.

## Recent Issues and Solutions

### 1. Subtask Form Data Issues
- **Problem**: Form data wasn't being saved properly when editing subtasks
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper change detection in saveSubTask function
  - Improved comparison of original vs current values

  - Fixed value handling for all field types

### 2. Subtask Actions Not Working
- **Problem**: View/Edit/Delete buttons weren't working in task view/edit pages
- **Solution**:
  - Added event delegation for DataTable buttons
  - Ensured proper event handlers in both view and edit pages
  - Fixed button click handling for dynamic content

### 3. Code Quality Issues
- **Problem**: Truncated file updates leading to broken functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Always output complete file contents when making changes
  - Maintain full context when updating templates
  - Include all necessary scripts and event handlers

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing and Validation**
