fix: restore correct route structure in Projects plugin

- Move index route from __init__.py back to routes.py
- Simplify __init__.py to match dispatch plugin structure
- Fix navigation system's ability to find 'projects.index' endpoint
- Resolve 500 error in base template rendering

This commit fixes the routing issue by restoring the correct plugin structure
where all routes are defined in routes.py. The __init__.py file now follows
the standard plugin pattern, matching the structure used by the dispatch
plugin. This ensures proper route registration and navigation functionality.
