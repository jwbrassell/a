fix: Subtask description field not displaying or saving correctly

- Added rich-text-editor class to description textarea to enable TinyMCE
- Added dark mode styling for TinyMCE editor to match theme
- Updated JavaScript to properly handle TinyMCE initialization and content
- Added proper handling of readonly mode for description field
- Added proper cleanup when modal is closed
- Fixed timing issues by adding delay when setting editor content

This fixes the issue where subtask descriptions were being sent but not displayed in the form.
