  * navigation_management.html for navigation ordering

  * role_management.js for role-related operations
  * route_mapping.js for route mapping and category operations

- Enhance category management:
  * Add icon selection for new categories
  * Improve category editing interface
  * Add icon preview functionality

- Update admin blueprint documentation:
  * Add Mermaid diagrams for:
    - Component structure visualization
    - Data flow sequences
    - Route relationships
    - Database schema ERD

This change improves code organization, maintainability, and developer
