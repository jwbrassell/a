rollback: remove Redis in favor of SimpleCache

- Removed Redis dependencies and configurations
- Switched to SimpleCache for caching backend
- Using SQLAlchemy for session storage instead of Redis
- Removed Redis monitoring and health check endpoints
- Updated configuration files to remove Redis settings

This rollback was necessary due to issues encountered while trying to
set up Redis integration. We'll stick with SimpleCache for now as it's
more straightforward and doesn't require external dependencies.
