fix: standardize project plugin routes and breadcrumbs

This commit fixes issues with the projects plugin routes and breadcrumbs by:

1. Added created_by columns to project-related tables:
   - project_status
   - project_priority
   - project
   - task
   - todo
   - comment
   - history

2. Standardized breadcrumb implementation:
   - Removed custom breadcrumb implementations from templates
   - Ensured all plugins use NavigationManager for consistent breadcrumbs

3. Fixed project route registration:
   - Created register_project_routes.py to properly register routes
   - Cleaned up duplicate route mappings
   - Converted URL paths to endpoint format:
     * projects.index -> Projects
     * projects.create_project -> Create Project
     * projects.list_projects -> Project List

4. Added utility scripts:
   - add_created_by_columns.py: Adds required columns to tables
   - cleanup_project_routes.py: Removes duplicate route mappings
   - register_project_routes.py: Registers routes in proper format

These changes ensure:
- Consistent breadcrumb navigation across all plugins
- Proper route registration in PageRouteMapping table
- Correct database schema with required columns
- Clean route mappings without duplicates

Testing:
- Verified all project routes appear in navigation
- Confirmed breadcrumbs work consistently
- Validated database schema changes
