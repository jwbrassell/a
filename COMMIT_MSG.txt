feat(plugins): Add user profile plugin

Add a new plugin that provides user profile functionality accessible from both
the top-right dropdown menu and left sidebar navigation.

Key changes:
- Create profile plugin with blueprint and metadata
- Add profile view template showing user information
- Add route_exists template filter for conditional rendering
- Update base template to include profile links
- Add comprehensive plugin documentation

Technical details:
- Plugin follows application's plugin architecture pattern
- Uses conditional rendering to handle plugin availability
- Requires only authentication, no specific role requirements
- Positioned above logout in navigation (weight: 98)
- Includes detailed README with implementation details

This commit provides a foundation for future profile-related features like
profile editing, picture upload, and security settings.
