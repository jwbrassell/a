feat: implement multi-level caching system

- Add Flask-Caching extension for in-memory caching support
- Cache static file imports template to reduce server load
- Add browser-side caching for static assets (30 days)
- Configure cache headers for optimal static file delivery
- Add loading overlay to improve page transitions

This implements a comprehensive caching system that:
1. Uses in-memory caching for templates and expensive operations
2. Leverages browser caching for static assets
3. Provides a smooth loading experience during navigation

These changes significantly improve application performance by reducing
server load and minimizing unnecessary file downloads.
