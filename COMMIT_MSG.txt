fix: Update project edit view layout and task handling

- Maintain consistent two-column layout throughout edit view
- Fix task table to use modal interactions instead of direct URLs
- Remove invalid route references (projects.view_task)
- Update task actions to use JavaScript handlers for view/edit/delete
- Keep edit view aligned with view template structure

This change ensures the edit view maintains a consistent layout while
properly handling task interactions through modals instead of separate
pages, fixing the 500 error caused by invalid route references.
