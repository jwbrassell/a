fix: Activity history not showing in profile

- Updated profile template to use server-side DataTable processing
- Modified activity tracking decorator to commit activities immediately
- Improved activity table UI with search, sort, and pagination
- Added loading indicator for better UX during data fetch

This fixes the issue where user activity history wasn't displaying in the profile page by properly implementing server-side processing and ensuring activities are committed to the database.
