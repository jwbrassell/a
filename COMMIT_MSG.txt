refactor: migrate plugins to core modules

This commit completes the migration of plugins to core modules:

1. Migrated admin, profile, and documents plugins to core modules:
   - Moved routes to app/routes/{admin,profile,documents}/
   - Moved models to app/models/
   - Updated imports and dependencies

2. Reorganized analytics:
   - Created app/models/analytics.py for all analytics models
   - Renamed metadata column to context_data to avoid SQLAlchemy conflicts
   - Updated activity tracking to use new analytics models

3. Fixed circular imports:
   - Restructured route initialization
   - Moved route registration to __init__.py files
   - Added proper blueprint initialization

4. Added core functionality:
   - Profile avatar and preferences management
   - Admin monitoring and analytics
   - Document management with templates

5. Updated documentation:
   - Added route documentation
   - Updated setup instructions
   - Fixed admin password references

The application now runs with all core functionality integrated directly into the main app structure, improving maintainability and reducing plugin overhead.
