fix: oncall auto-schedule upload template mismatch

Fixed issue with oncall auto-schedule upload where template requirements didn't match the selected mode:

- Added separate template download links for manual and auto-generate modes
- Updated auto_generate checkbox handler to toggle visibility of appropriate template
- Ensured auto_generate parameter is properly set as 'true'/'false' in form data
- Added template visibility reset when upload modal is closed

Manual mode:
- Shows template with week, name, phone columns
- Requires all three columns in CSV

Auto-generate mode:
- Shows template with only name, phone columns
- Only requires these two columns for fair schedule generation

This prevents the "Missing required fields" error when using auto-generate mode with the correct template.
