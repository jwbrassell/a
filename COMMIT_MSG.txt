fix(projects): resolve blueprint registration and route organization

- Remove duplicate projects_bp from projects/__init__.py
- Use main bp from plugin's __init__.py consistently
- Fix route organization:
  * Move CRUD operations to projects/crud.py
  * Keep view routes in project_routes.py
  * Keep management routes in management_routes.py
- Fix Task model filtering:
  * Use list_position instead of status relationship
  * Update task count queries in main_routes.py
- Fix create project form:
  * Add dummy project object for template
  * Initialize empty relationships
  * Add proper status and priority lists

This fixes issues with:
- Blueprint registration conflicts
- Route duplication
- Task status filtering
- Project creation form display

Testing:
1. Project listing works
2. Create project form displays properly
3. Task counts show correctly
4. Project management features work
