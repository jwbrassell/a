feat: restored project functionality and enhanced task management

- Restored project.js with complete task and todo management functionality
- Added create-task-modal to view.html for task creation/editing
- Updated imports.html to properly include project.js and dependencies
- Added Sortable.js for todo list drag-and-drop functionality
- Added TinyMCE for rich text editing support

These changes restore and improve functionality by:
- Enabling full task management (view, create, edit, delete)
- Supporting todo list features (create, toggle, delete, reorder)
- Providing proper modal handling for task operations
- Ensuring all JavaScript dependencies are properly loaded
- Maintaining proper separation of concerns between view and edit modes
