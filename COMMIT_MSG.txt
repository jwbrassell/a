refactor(projects): reorganize route imports to prevent conflicts

- Remove duplicate view_project route definitions
- Organize route imports in a hierarchical structure:
  1. Core project routes (crud, team, todos)
  2. Task-specific routes (crud, dependencies, ordering)
  3. Supporting feature routes (comments, subtasks)
- Add detailed documentation explaining route organization
- Fix task creation by ensuring proper route registration
- Maintain separation of concerns between route modules

This change resolves route conflicts and provides a clearer structure
for the project plugin's routing system, making it easier to maintain
and extend in the future.
