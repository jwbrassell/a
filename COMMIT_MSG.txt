Fix navigation menu categories and collapsible behavior

This commit fixes issues with the navigation menu's category handling and collapsible behavior. The changes ensure proper display of categorized routes and smooth category expansion/collapse.

Key Changes:

1. Route Manager Updates:
- Modified route_to_endpoint() to better handle blueprint routes
- Removed route existence check during mapping to allow routes to be registered later
- Fixed handling of route paths vs endpoints
- Improved blueprint prefix handling

2. Navigation Manager Updates:
- Updated get_user_navigation() to properly handle category relationships
- Fixed category filtering to show proper categorized and uncategorized routes
- Improved handling of nav_category relationship

3. JavaScript Improvements:
- Added proper event handlers for category expansion/collapse
- Implemented localStorage for menu state persistence
- Added smooth animations for category transitions
- Fixed icon rotation during expand/collapse
- Added visual indicators for nested menu items

4. CSS Enhancements:
- Added proper indentation for nested menu items
- Improved visual hierarchy with connecting lines
- Added smooth transitions for icon rotation
- Fixed menu item spacing and alignment

The result is a properly functioning navigation menu where:
- Routes are correctly categorized (Individual, Tools, etc.)
- Categories expand/collapse smoothly
- Menu state persists across page loads
- Visual hierarchy clearly shows nested items
- Routes are properly indented under their categories

This fixes the core issue where categories weren't being properly displayed and menu items weren't collapsing correctly.
