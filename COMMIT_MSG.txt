Standardize AWS Monitor Plugin

Standardized the AWS Monitor plugin to follow established patterns:

- Split routes into logical modules:
  - instance_routes.py: EC2 instance management
  - synthetic_routes.py: Synthetic testing functionality
  - template_routes.py: Jump server template management

- Enhanced models with standardized fields:
  - Added user tracking (created_by, updated_by)
  - Added timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
  - Added soft delete support (deleted_at)
  - Created migration script

- Implemented PluginBase:
  - Converted to use PluginBase class
  - Enhanced plugin metadata
  - Added explicit permissions list
  - Standardized initialization

- Added comprehensive testing:
  - Unit tests for all functionality
  - Integration tests with core
  - Permission verification
  - Route accessibility tests
  - Template rendering tests

- Updated documentation:
  - Added plugin-specific documentation
  - Updated migration plan
  - Documented API endpoints and models

Part of the plugin standardization initiative.
