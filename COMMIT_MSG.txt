refactor(projects): improve save functionality and CSRF handling

- Add CSRF token handling to all project-related API calls
- Change auto-save to explicit save button functionality
- Add visual indicators for unsaved changes
- Fix duplicate event handling for select fields
- Make save buttons consistent across UI
- Add safety mechanisms for unsaved changes
- Update both floating and bottom save buttons together

This improves the user experience by:
1. Making save behavior more predictable
2. Preventing accidental data loss
3. Providing clear feedback about unsaved changes
4. Ensuring consistent button states
5. Adding proper security with CSRF tokens
