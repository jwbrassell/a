docs: add hello plugin README and update main documentation

- Create comprehensive README for hello plugin demonstrating system features
- Add table of contents to main README for improved navigation
- Include plugin documentation section in main README
- Add summaries and links to all plugin documentation (Profile, Dispatch, Hello)

providing clear guidance on installation, features, and usage. The main
