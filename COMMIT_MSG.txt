refactor: simplify handoff creation and improve UI

- Remove workcenter dropdown from index page since it's determined by user
- Make from_shift column nullable and set default value to "Self"
- Fix closed handoffs not appearing in table
- Improve error handling in form submission
- Add loading state to submit button
- Simplify routes to use user's current workcenter

These changes streamline the handoff creation process by removing unnecessary
UI elements and making the workflow more intuitive. The form now properly
handles errors and provides better feedback to users.
