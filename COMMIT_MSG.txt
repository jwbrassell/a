Technical Details:
1. Added column filters to report views:
```html
<tr class="filters">
    <th>
        <input type="text" class="form-control form-control-sm column-filter" 
               placeholder="Search {{ col.display }}"
               data-column="{{ loop.index0 }}">
    </th>
</tr>
```

2. Enhanced DataTables configuration:
```javascript
orderCellsTop: true,
fixedHeader: true,
initComplete: function() {
    api.columns().every(function() {
        var column = this;
        $('.column-filter').on('keyup change', function() {
            column.search(this.value).draw();
        });
    });
}
```

3. Added URL parameter persistence:
- Filters are saved in URL parameters
- Filters are restored on page load
- URL updates when filters change

4. Improved JavaScript organization:
- Moved shared functions to report_utils.js
- Used ES5 syntax for compatibility
- Better error handling
- Proper event handling

Testing:
1. View any report and verify column filters work
2. Test filters work together (AND logic)
3. Refresh page to verify filter persistence
4. Edit a report and test all functionality
5. Verify breadcrumbs navigation works
6. Test on different screen sizes

Note: This update significantly improves the usability of the reports plugin,
making it easier to find and filter data while providing a more robust
editing experience.
