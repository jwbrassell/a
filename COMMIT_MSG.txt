fix(oncall): resolve route handling and navigation issues

- Remove export_schedule from navigation due to required parameters
- Add Operations category for oncall plugin routes
- Update navigation macro to handle parameterized routes
- Fix route_manager.py to properly handle oncall routes
- Add comprehensive README for oncall plugin

The oncall plugin was experiencing navigation issues due to the export_schedule 
route requiring parameters (team_id and year) that couldn't be automatically 
generated in the navigation menu. This caused the entire application to fail 
when trying to build URLs.

Changes made:
- Modified fix_oncall_routes.py to exclude export_schedule from navigation
- Created Operations category for better organization
- Updated navigation macro to handle routes with required parameters
- Removed special case handling in route_manager.py
- Added detailed documentation in README.md

The plugin now properly integrates with the core application's navigation 
system while maintaining all functionality. The export_schedule endpoint 
remains accessible through the UI where parameters can be properly provided.

Testing:
- Verified routes are properly registered
- Confirmed navigation loads without errors
- Checked all oncall routes are under Operations category
- Validated export functionality still works through UI
