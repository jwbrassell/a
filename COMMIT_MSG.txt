fix: add admin plugin models to database initialization

- Import admin plugin models (SystemMetric, ApplicationMetric, UserMetric, FeatureUsage, ResourceMetric) in init_db.py
- Ensure feature usage tracking tables are created during database initialization
- Fix "no such table: feature_usage" error by properly creating required tables

This change ensures that all necessary tables for feature usage tracking and monitoring are properly created when initializing the database, preventing SQLite operational errors when the application attempts to track feature usage.
