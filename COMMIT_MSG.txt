feat(admin): Add vault monitoring dashboard

Adds a comprehensive vault monitoring system to the admin plugin with:

- Real-time health monitoring with status indicators:
  * Overall health (healthy/degraded/error)
  * Seal status
  * Initialization status
  * Version tracking

- Visual analytics:
  * Health gauge showing system status (0-100%)
  * Secret engines distribution chart

- Detailed system information:
  * Cluster details
  * Secret engine mounts
  * Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

Security:
- Added .env.vault to .gitignore to prevent token exposure
- Vault tokens and unseal keys should be managed securely
- Development tokens should never be committed to source control

This enhances our admin capabilities with real-time vault health monitoring
and visualization, making it easier to track vault status and identify issues.
