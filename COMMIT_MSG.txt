fix: resolve SQLAlchemy session table conflicts during setup

- Add skip_session parameter to create_app to avoid session initialization during setup
- Update init_reports_data to use db.session.query instead of Model.query
- Modify setup.py to skip session initialization during database setup
- Keep SQLAlchemy session configuration for normal app operation
- Fix database initialization order to prevent table conflicts

This resolves the issue where Flask-Session was trying to create its session
table while other tables were being created, causing conflicts in the SQLAlchemy
metadata. The setup process now properly initializes the database without session
conflicts while maintaining database session support during normal operation.
