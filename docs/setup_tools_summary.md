## Reports and Logs

All tools generate detailed reports in their respective directories:

```
reports/
├── audit_reports/       # Deployment audit reports
├── verification_reports/  # Deployment verification reports
├── requirements_reports/  # Plugin requirements reports
├── routes_reports/       # Plugin routes reports

```

## Common Tasks

### Setting Up a New Environment
1. Run environment setup:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/setup_new_environment.py
   ```
2. Follow the generated setup script
3. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/verify_deployment.py
   ```

### Backing Up Data
1. Create backup:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/backup_plugin_data.py
   ```
2. Store backup archive securely

### Restoring Data
1. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/restore_plugin_data.py backup_file.zip
   ```
2. Verify restoration:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/verify_deployment.py
   ```

### Migrating to New Environment
1. Create migration package:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/migrate_plugin_data.py
   ```
2. Transfer package to new environment
3. Import data:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/import_plugin_data.py migration_package.zip
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Always run verification after major changes:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/verify_deployment.py
   ```

2. Create regular backups:
   ```bash
   python utils/setup/backup_plugin_data.py
   ```

3. Keep backup archives secure and organized

4. Document any environment-specific configurations

5. Monitor verification reports for issues

6. Test restoration procedures regularly

## Troubleshooting

1. Check the latest reports in the respective reports directory
2. Review application logs in the logs directory
3. Verify all required services are running
4. Ensure proper permissions on files and directories
5. Validate configuration files
6. Check plugin requirements and dependencies
