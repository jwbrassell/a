# Plugin to Core Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to migrate certain plugins into core application features. The goal is to improve maintainability and reflect the true nature of these features while preserving functionality.

## Migration Progress

### 1. Admin Plugin (✓ Completed)
- Core functionality includes:
  - User management
  - Role management
  - System monitoring
  - Analytics
- Migration completed:
  - ✓ Moved models to core `app/models/`
  - ✓ Created core routes in `app/routes/admin/`
  - ✓ Moved templates to core `app/templates/admin/`
  - ✓ Updated imports and references
  - ✓ Integrated with core application initialization
  - ✓ Preserved all functionality including:
    - User management
    - Role management
    - Analytics dashboard
    - System monitoring
    - Vault integration

### 2. Profile Plugin (✓ Completed)
- Core user profile functionality
- Migration completed:
  - ✓ Moved models to core `app/models/`
  - ✓ Integrated routes with user management in `app/routes/profile/`
  - ✓ Moved templates to core `app/templates/profile/`
  - ✓ Updated user model relationships

### 3. Documents Plugin (Next)
- Central document management system
- Migration steps:
  1. Move models to core `app/models/`
  2. Create dedicated routes module `app/routes/documents/`
  3. Move templates to core `app/templates/documents/`
  4. Update file storage configuration

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (✓ Completed for Admin & Profile)
1. Create new directory structure:
```
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── admin/          ✓ Completed
│   ├── profile/        ✓ Completed
│   └── documents/      (Next)
├── templates/
│   ├── admin/          ✓ Completed
│   ├── profile/        ✓ Completed
│   └── documents/      (Next)
```

### Phase 2: Iterative Migration

1. Admin Plugin Migration (✓ Completed):
- ✓ Migrated all routes and APIs
- ✓ Preserved URL structures
- ✓ Maintained permissions and access control
- ✓ Updated blueprint registration
- ✓ Integrated with core app initialization

2. Profile Plugin Migration (✓ Completed):
- ✓ Migrated all profile routes
- ✓ Updated user profile integration
- ✓ Maintained template structure
- ✓ Preserved user settings functionality

3. Documents Plugin Migration (Next):
```python
# To be implemented in app/routes/documents/routes.py
from flask import Blueprint

documents_bp = Blueprint('documents', __name__, url_prefix='/documents')
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. Create test cases for migrated functionality
2. Verify all routes work as expected
3. Check permissions and access control
4. Validate database operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Model Migration
- Move models to appropriate core modules
- Update relationships and imports
- Maintain existing table names for data compatibility

### 2. Route Migration
- Preserve URL structures
- Update blueprint registrations
- Maintain route decorators and middleware

### 3. Template Migration
- Keep template hierarchy
- Update template paths in route handlers
- Preserve template inheritance

### 4. Static Files
- Move to core static directory
- Update asset references
- Maintain URL patterns

## Rollback Plan

For each migration:
1. Keep plugin code until migration is verified
2. Document all changes
3. Create database backups
4. Maintain old routes temporarily with redirects

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. Clean up:
- Remove old plugin directories
- Update documentation
- Remove unused dependencies

2. Update tests:
- Move plugin tests to core test suite
- Update test configurations
- Add integration tests

3. Documentation:
- Update API documentation
- Update user guides
- Document new core features

## Next Steps

1. Documents Plugin Migration:
- Plan storage integration
- Design core document models
- Create route structure
- Migrate templates
- Test file operations

## Success Criteria

1. All functionality preserved
2. No regression in performance
3. Improved code organization
4. Simplified maintenance
5. Better integration with core features
6. Comprehensive test coverage
7. Updated documentation

## Monitoring & Validation

1. Performance Metrics:
- Response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage

2. Error Monitoring:
- Error rates
- Log analysis
- User reports

3. Usage Analytics:
- Feature usage patterns
- User engagement
- System health

## Future Considerations

1. API Standardization:
- Consistent endpoint structure
- Standardized response formats
- Improved error handling

2. Feature Integration:
- Better cross-feature communication
- Shared utilities
- Consistent user experience

3. Scalability:
- Optimized database queries
- Improved caching
- Better resource utilization

## Lessons Learned from Admin & Profile Migrations

1. Blueprint Organization:
- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear module boundaries
- Maintain consistent naming

2. Code Structure:
- Separate concerns (routes, APIs, models)
- Clear initialization pattern
- Consistent error handling

3. Integration Points:
- Early blueprint registration
- Careful permission management
- Proper template organization

4. Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance benchmarks

## Timeline

1. Admin Plugin (✓ Completed)
- Migration completed successfully
- All functionality preserved
- Tests passing

2. Profile Plugin (✓ Completed)
