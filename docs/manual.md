### Caching System

The application implements a multi-level caching system to optimize performance:

#### 1. In-Memory Caching
- Uses Flask-Caching for server-side caching
- Caches rendered templates and expensive operations
- Default cache timeout: 1 hour for templates
- Example usage in routes:
```python
from app.extensions import cache

@app.route('/expensive-operation')
@cache.cached(timeout=300)  # Cache for 5 minutes
def expensive_operation():
    # Expensive operation here
    return result
```

#### 2. Browser-Side Caching
- Implements cache headers for static files
- Cache duration: 30 days for static assets
- Includes CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files
- Configuration in config.py:
```python
# Static file configuration
STATIC_CACHE_TIMEOUT = 2592000  # 30 days in seconds
```

#### 3. Template Caching
- Caches frequently used templates like imports.html
- Reduces server load for common components
- Usage in templates:
```jinja
{{ get_cached_imports()|safe }}
```

#### Cache Configuration
The caching system can be configured through the following settings:
- CACHE_TYPE: Type of caching backend (default: SimpleCache)
- CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: Default cache timeout in seconds
- STATIC_CACHE_TIMEOUT: Browser cache duration for static files

#### Best Practices
1. Cache expensive database queries
2. Use appropriate cache timeouts based on data volatility
3. Implement cache invalidation when data changes
4. Monitor cache hit rates and adjust timeouts accordingly
